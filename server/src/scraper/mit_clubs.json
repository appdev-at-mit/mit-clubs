Since then, Borderline has expanded to over 65 murals in the tunnels and Banana Lounge (26-110) on campus. More murals and animations are being added every semester.Beyond the tunnels, Borderline has collaborated on projects with numerous organizations, such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Porto Seguro Cultural Center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Borderline has been featured in The Boston Globe, VICE Motherboard, and other publications.The magic of Borderline comes in the form of augmented reality via the Artivive app, available for Android and iOS.

    "mission": "The purpose of the MIT Open Discourse Society (MODS) is to cultivate civil discourse and intellectual diversity within the MIT community. MIT is the global STEM epicenter, and for so long, advancements in science and technology here and elsewhere have stemmed from the willingness to engage in productive discussions and good-faith evaluation of ideas.MODS aims to recreate environments where such discussions and evaluation are the norm and devoid of bigoted obloquy. Such environments range from speaker events and panel discussions to roundtables and workshops to networking events that connect students with professionals who have taken a stand for free speech.In this era where censorship and crackdowns dominate, it is more important than ever to uphold the integrity of open inquiry that is embedded within MIT's long-standing tradition of creativity and curiosity and the broader nature of the scientific process. MODS exists precisely for this purpose.",

Our term shows are usually Shakespearean plays directed by a hired professional director. The IAP and summer shows are usually student-directed, and we often branch out to other playwrights. We also perform Scene Nights (performances of short scenes from any play) and 24 Hour Shows (during which we write and rehearse a show all within 24 hours!) the year.

We aim to create a safe, inclusive space where individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to learn, share, and discuss the complex histories and ongoing effects of imperialism in an expressive manner.While our main purpose is a monthly publication, our activities include organizing reading groups, writing workshops, guest lectures, and discussion forums focused on anti-imperialist literature, historical texts, and contemporary analyses. Through these initiatives, we seek to highlight the voices and stories of those affected by imperialism, challenge prevailing narratives, and encourage critical thinking among our members.",
